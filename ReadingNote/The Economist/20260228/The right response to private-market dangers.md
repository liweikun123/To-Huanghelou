# The right response to private-market dangers

Was a Blue Owl fund mismanaged, or did it reveal fundamental problems about the industry?

February 26th 2026

The giants of private investment risk seeing a tantalising prize slip from their grasp. Three of the biggest—Apollo, Blackstone and KKR—collectively oversee assets that have ballooned to $3trn, from $200bn in 2008. So far, they have had to raise the lion’s share of this from a select group of financial institutions and the über-rich. Now they and their competitors have the mass market in their sights. They have launched a wave of funds designed to entice retail savers to invest in unlisted assets such as private equity, property and private debt.

Their whole endeavour may now be under threat. On February 18th Blue Owl, a little-known firm, halted planned withdrawals from one of its retail funds. “OBDC II” has assets worth just $1.6bn. Yet news that Blue Owl has stopped redemptions, and is instead selling assets to return capital to all its investors, has sent shockwaves through the industry. Share prices fell in much bigger listed private-investment managers; half a dozen of them have lost a combined $100bn in market value since the start of the year.

That is because Blue Owl turned out to be a coal-mine canary. OBDC II has cast doubt on the model that such firms had hoped would “democratise” private investment and win them new revenue streams. Private-investment firms and their backers must now urgently work out what went wrong. Light regulation has let their markets boom for the better part of two decades. They cannot expect this to continue if they sell products to retail investors and do not honour their promises.

At stake are not just the revenues of a few asset managers. Access to private markets promises retail investors a way to share in big potential returns. The vast majority of the world’s assets are unlisted, including many of the most exciting businesses. Putting retail investors’ savings to work in private markets would also be a boon for the wider economy. Companies developing artificial intelligence are ravenous for capital, and Blue Owl’s funds are important lenders to them. In America in particular, such firms’ prospects will increasingly determine both the rate of growth and how well the country competes with China.

OBDC II aspired to solve a long-standing problem with retail investments in private markets. Directing savings towards private assets is difficult because they are illiquid. This makes regulators wary and puts off investors who like being able to buy or sell at the drop of a hat—if they need cash for an emergency, say. OBDC II used a model popularised by Blackstone’s Real Estate Income Trust, launched in 2017, which offers limited liquidity. Investors can ask to cash out each month or quarter, but the fund agrees to process total redemptions worth up to only 5% of its net asset value each quarter. Should requests exceed that figure, it caps the total at 5% and grants them pro rata.

Whether Blue Owl’s failure to stick to this was caused by its own incompetence, or by a fundamental flaw in the model, is still unclear. The very fact that this question remains unanswered should disturb anyone with a stake in institutions, such as pension schemes and university endowments, that are heavily exposed to unlisted assets. If regulators do not require funds like OBDC II to disclose far more about how they manage liquidity mismatches, their investors surely must.

Fortunately, the odds favour incompetence. A fund granting quarterly redemptions worth up to 5% of its assets is hardly promising the moon: at worst, it is offering to sell its portfolio over five years. This is the same as the typical wind-down period for standard private-markets funds. Providing regular liquidity ought to be especially easy for private-credit funds of OBDC II’s variety, since these invest in loans that pay interest, which can be used to meet redemptions.

For these reasons, it would be a mistake for zealous regulators to make it harder for ordinary people to buy private assets. It is, in truth, suspicious that private-investment giants are racing to sell to the mass market just when deals between them have slowed. But amateur investors are capable of scepticism. They can judge, for instance, the wisdom of investing in once-buzzy firms that were bought out during the mania of 2021, at “fair values” set by the seller. They should not expect to be bailed out—as they might if their bank collapsed—after making unwise investments.

Investors, meanwhile, should use their market power. They should not give money to managers whose operations are too opaque to understand. No fund promising annual returns in the high single-digit percentage points, or more, is a safe bet. It might hold loans that could fall through, property that could be left vacant or firms that could fail. If it also offers liquidity, while investing in illiquid assets, it could fail there, too. Responsible asset managers should help clients scrutinise these risks. If they do not, their golden opportunity may slip away. ■

# The right response to private-market dangers

# 应对私募市场风险的正确策略

**Was a Blue Owl fund mismanaged, or did it reveal fundamental problems about the industry?**
**蓝头鹰（Blue Owl）的一只基金是管理不善，还是揭示了该行业的根本问题？**

February 26th 2026
2026年2月26日

The giants of private investment risk seeing a **tantalising** prize **slip from their grasp**. Three of the biggest—Apollo, Blackstone and KKR—collectively oversee assets that have **ballooned** to $3trn, from $200bn in 2008. So far, they have had to raise the **lion’s share** of this from a select group of financial institutions and the **über-rich**. Now they and their competitors have the mass market in their **sights**. They have launched a wave of funds designed to **entice** retail savers to invest in **unlisted assets** such as private equity, property and private debt.

私募投资巨头们正面临着眼看着一个**诱人的**奖赏从**手中溜走**的风险。阿波罗（Apollo）、黑石（Blackstone）和KKR这三家最大的巨头共同管理的资产已从2008年的2000亿美元**激增**至3万亿美元。到目前为止，这些资金中的**绝大部分**不得不从特定的金融机构和**超级富豪**那里筹集。现在，他们及其竞争对手已将目光**瞄准**了大众市场。他们推出了一波基金，旨在**诱使**散户储户投资于私募股权、房地产和私募债等**非上市资产**。

Their whole **endeavour** may now be under threat. On February 18th Blue Owl, a little-known firm, halted planned withdrawals from one of its retail funds. “OBDC II” has assets worth just $1.6bn. Yet news that Blue Owl has stopped **redemptions**, and is instead selling assets to return capital to all its investors, has sent **shockwaves** through the industry. Share prices fell in much bigger listed private-investment managers; half a dozen of them have lost a combined $100bn in market value since the start of the year.

他们的整个**努力/尝试**现在可能面临威胁。2月18日，一家名为蓝头鹰（Blue Owl）的知名度较低的公司停止了其一只零售基金的计划赎回。“OBDC II”拥有的资产价值仅为16亿美元。然而，蓝头鹰停止**赎回**转而出售资产以向所有投资者返还资本的消息，在整个行业引起了**震动**。规模大得多的上市私募投资管理公司的股价纷纷下跌；自年初以来，其中六家公司的市值合计缩水了1000亿美元。

That is because Blue Owl turned out to be a **coal-mine canary**. OBDC II has cast doubt on the model that such firms had hoped would “**democratise**” private investment and win them new **revenue streams**. Private-investment firms and their backers must now urgently work out what went wrong. Light regulation has let their markets boom for the **better part of** two decades. They cannot expect this to continue if they sell products to retail investors and do not **honour their promises**.

这是因为蓝头鹰被证明是**煤矿里的金丝雀（早期预警信号）**。OBDC II 让人对这类公司曾希望实现的私募投资“**大众化/民主化**”并为其赢得新**收入来源**的模式产生了怀疑。私募投资公司及其支持者现在必须迫切查明出了什么问题。在过去二十年的**大部分时间**里，宽松的监管让他们的市场蓬勃发展。如果他们向散户投资者销售产品却不**履行承诺**，就不能指望这种情况继续下去。

At stake are not just the revenues of a few asset managers. Access to private markets promises retail investors a way to share in big potential returns. The vast majority of the world’s assets are unlisted, including many of the most exciting businesses. Putting retail investors’ savings to work in private markets would also be a **boon** for the wider economy. Companies developing artificial intelligence are **ravenous** for capital, and Blue Owl’s funds are important lenders to them. In America in particular, such firms’ prospects will increasingly determine both the rate of growth and how well the country competes with China.

受到威胁的不仅仅是几家资产管理公司的收入。进入私募市场为散户投资者提供了一种分享巨大潜在收益的方式。世界上绝大多数资产都是非上市的，包括许多最令人兴奋的企业。将散户投资者的储蓄投入私募市场，对更广泛的经济而言也将是一个**福音**。开发人工智能的公司对资金**极度渴求**，而蓝头鹰的基金是它们的重要贷款方。特别是在美国，此类公司的前景将日益决定经济增长率以及该国与中国竞争的能力。

OBDC II **aspired** to solve a long-standing problem with retail investments in private markets. Directing savings towards private assets is difficult because they are **illiquid**. This makes regulators **wary** and puts off investors who like being able to buy or sell **at the drop of a hat**—if they need cash for an emergency, say. OBDC II used a model **popularised** by Blackstone’s Real Estate Income Trust, launched in 2017, which offers limited **liquidity**. Investors can ask to cash out each month or quarter, but the fund agrees to process total redemptions worth up to only 5% of its net asset value each quarter. Should requests exceed that figure, it **caps** the total at 5% and grants them **pro rata**.

OBDC II **渴望**解决私募市场零售投资长期存在的一个问题。将储蓄引向私募资产是很困难的，因为这些资产**缺乏流动性**。这让监管机构保持**警惕**，也让那些希望能够**随时随地/立即**买卖的投资者望而却步——比方说，如果他们需要现金应急的话。OBDC II采用了黑石房地产收入信托基金（Blackstone’s Real Estate Income Trust）于2017年推出并**推广**的模式，该模式提供有限的**流动性**。投资者可以要求每月或每季度兑现，但基金同意每季度处理的总赎回额最高仅为其净资产值的5%。如果申请额超过该数字，它会将总额**限制**在5%，并**按比例**分配。

Whether Blue Owl’s failure to **stick to** this was caused by its own **incompetence**, or by a fundamental **flaw** in the model, is still unclear. The very fact that this question remains unanswered should **disturb** anyone with a **stake** in institutions, such as pension schemes and university endowments, that are heavily **exposed to** unlisted assets. If regulators do not require funds like OBDC II to **disclose** far more about how they manage **liquidity mismatches**, their investors surely must.

蓝头鹰未能**坚持/遵守**这一规定是因为其自身的**无能**，还是因为该模式存在根本性**缺陷**，目前尚不清楚。这一问题悬而未决的事实本身，就应该让所有在养老金计划和大学捐赠基金等机构中拥有**利益**的人感到**不安**，因为这些机构大量**涉及/持有**非上市资产。如果监管机构不要求像OBDC II这样的基金**披露**更多关于它们如何管理**流动性错配**的信息，那么它们的投资者肯定会要求这样做。

Fortunately, the **odds** favour incompetence. A fund granting quarterly redemptions worth up to 5% of its assets is hardly **promising the moon**: at worst, it is offering to sell its portfolio over five years. This is the same as the typical **wind-down** period for standard private-markets funds. Providing regular liquidity ought to be especially easy for private-credit funds of OBDC II’s variety, since these invest in loans that pay interest, which can be used to **meet redemptions**.

幸运的是，**可能性**更倾向于是管理无能。一只允许每季度赎回高达资产5%的基金很难说是**许下无法实现的诺言**：最坏的情况下，它是在提议用五年时间卖出其投资组合。这与标准私募市场基金典型的**清算/关闭**期相同。对于OBDC II这种类型的私募信贷基金来说，提供定期流动性应该特别容易，因为它们投资于支付利息的贷款，而利息可以用来**满足赎回需求**。

For these reasons, it would be a mistake for **zealous** regulators to make it harder for ordinary people to buy private assets. It is, in truth, **suspicious** that private-investment giants are racing to sell to the mass market just when deals between them have slowed. But **amateur** investors are capable of **scepticism**. They can judge, for instance, the wisdom of investing in once-**buzzy** firms that were bought out during the **mania** of 2021, at “fair values” set by the seller. They should not expect to be **bailed out**—as they might if their bank collapsed—after making unwise investments.

基于这些原因，**过分热心的**监管机构如果让普通人购买私募资产变得更加困难，那将是一个错误。事实上，私募投资巨头们恰恰在彼此间的交易放缓之际，竞相向大众市场推销，这确实令人生疑。但**业余**投资者是有能力产生**怀疑/批判性思考**的。例如，他们可以判断，投资于那些在2021年**狂热**时期被收购、并按卖家设定的“公允价值”估值的曾经**热门的**公司是否明智。在做出不明智的投资后，他们不应指望获得**救助**——就像如果他们的银行倒闭时可能会得到的那样。

Investors, meanwhile, should use their market power. They should not give money to managers whose operations are too **opaque** to understand. No fund promising annual returns in the **high single-digit** percentage points, or more, is a **safe bet**. It might hold loans that could **fall through**, property that could be left **vacant** or firms that could fail. If it also offers liquidity, while investing in **illiquid** assets, it could fail there, too. Responsible asset managers should help clients **scrutinise** these risks. If they do not, their **golden opportunity** may slip away. ■

与此同时，投资者应该利用他们的市场力量。他们不应该把钱交给那些运作过于**晦涩难懂**的管理人员。任何承诺年回报率在**较高个位数**百分点或更高水平的基金都不是**稳赚不赔的买卖**。它持有的贷款可能会**违约/告吹**，房产可能会**闲置**，公司可能会倒闭。如果它在投资于**缺乏流动性**的资产时还提供流动性，那么它在这一环节也可能出问题。负责任的资产管理者应该帮助客户**审视/细查**这些风险。如果他们不这样做，他们的**黄金机会**可能会溜走。
