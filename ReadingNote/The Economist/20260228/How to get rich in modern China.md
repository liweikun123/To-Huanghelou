# How to get rich in modern China

Some of the country’s brightest are cashing in on a state-backed surge

February 26th 2026

The year of the fire horse, which began on February 17th, is hardly galloping along for many Chinese. A property bust and chronic deflation have eroded people’s assets, incomes and prospects. Residential property, where Chinese people store the bulk of their wealth, has lost a fifth of its value on average since 2021. Wage growth is weak. And youth unemployment is hovering around 17%. Some graduates find themselves forced into precarious employment in the gig economy. Others say they are choosing to “lie flat” rather than look for a grinding job.

But in a sea of people losing, one group is winning. They are what Xi Jinping, China’s leader, calls nongchaoer: a Chinese term referring to those who “ride the tide” of great economic changes. Today that tide is flowing towards the strategic technologies, such as artificial intelligence and robotics, that dominate the country’s five-year plans for tech supremacy (the next one will be released in March and will cover the period to 2030). Smart, young and sometimes from modest backgrounds, the nongchaoer do not flash their growing wealth (and in any case, tend to prefer home-grown electric vehicles to Porsches). And they do not see officials as a source of pesky regulation to be avoided—but as their biggest backers. Mr Xi met a group of them publicly just before the lunar holiday.

These tide-riders are different from winners of the past in several ways. Education is an important one. In recent decades China’s economic rise created several waves of opportunity for the talented or lucky: from low-end manufacturing in the early 2000s to the rise of e-commerce in the 2010s and the property boom which lasted until 2021. Each minted its own millionaires and billionaires. In the boom times even a certificate from a backwater college could go a long way. In 2017 a survey of China’s 2,000 wealthiest entrepreneurs found that half had no degree at all.

But today’s nongchaoer are an elite bunch. They typically hold stem degrees from one of China’s top 40-odd universities, known as the “985” group, which every year produce just 460,000 of the country’s 12m graduates (including masters and PhD students). The youngest members of the group that Mr Xi met, for example, included Zhang Linfeng, the co-founder of a company applying AI to science; Chen Jianyu, the founder of a robotics firm; and Wang He, another roboticist working on embodied AI. All were born in the 1990s and graduated from “985” institutions.

Opportunities in China’s economy once lay in lots of places, from social connections to land. Now they primarily go to those who can grasp technology, says Li Jingyuan, a graduate of Zhejiang University (also a 985 college) and the founder of a company that makes 3D printers. Government data suggest that lucrative careers are increasingly concentrated in the highest echelons of tech. The financial sector, although still cushy, has seen only sluggish salary growth in the past few years amid a crackdown on bankers’ bonuses (see chart). Lawyers have fared worse.

But the top tenth of software engineers by salary have seen their wages grow by 8% per year in real terms since 2020. The cleverest engineers have enjoyed pay rises amid a war for talent among China’s big-tech companies. An ai researcher at one such company in Beijing admits he has far more money than he knows what to do with (he spends most of his time at work and his hobby, hiking, is hard to splash cash on). DeepSeek, China’s AI darling, has been offering salaries of more than 1.4m yuan ($200,000) per year, ten times that of the average white-collar worker in China.

Nongchaoer tend to concentrate in just a few places: Yizhuang, a tech district in Beijing, Shenzhen, a southern electronics-manufacturing hub, and Hangzhou, a canal-crossed city in eastern China. On the surface their offices mimic those in Silicon Valley, complete with beanbags, table football and wandering robots. But the difference lies in the looming presence of the government. The walls bear framed pictures of visiting Communist Party cadres and awards from local officials praising “model” companies.

Only recently China’s tech sector was battered by officialdom. In 2020 Jack Ma, the founder of the tech giant Alibaba, made a speech attacking regulators for stifling innovation with “outdated supervision”. Mr Ma then disappeared from public view for several months and officials blocked the planned initial public offering of one of his companies. China has since squeezed its tech sector, with regulators targeting everything from cryptocurrency exchanges to video-game developers. Officials prefer the brightest and best to be in the strategic industries China needs to compete with America. Mr Xi has urged tech workers to “cultivate feelings of devotion towards serving the country”.

The nongchaoer are keen to emphasise the ways officials help rather than hinder them. Policy can cause “uncertainties”, but it creates lots of “certainties” too, says Yi Haoxiang, the 35-year-old founder of a company in Hangzhou that makes AI-powered smart-glasses and a brain-computer interface intended to help treat depression (both are technologies the government has marked as national priorities). Local officials subsidise his research and development costs, office rent and travel to overseas conferences. Mr Yi praises the way officials “prevent excessive, destructive competition” by discouraging bidding wars over new patents from universities. “The government is the most stable force in the country, so the closer you get to it the more stable you become,” says Fred Chu, a 32-year-old whose company sells ai-powered monitoring software to the Hangzhou government for around 10m yuan a year. It is used for real-time tracking of road and environmental conditions.

State-guided innovation of this sort has its problems. Priorities are set by central-government officials betting on the technologies they happen to think will prove critical. Local officials burn cash supporting favoured but feeble firms in their neighbourhoods. And state-supported industries can lurch from glory to gore if subsidies are pulled back. But for a shrewd entrepreneur willing to surf where directed, money sloshes from local-government coffers, state-owned companies and national venture-capital funds. Just in December China’s central government announced a new 100bn-yuan fund to invest in startups. And it is hard to deny that some of the results from all this state involvement are impressive. Chinese tech companies are now globally competitive in everything from electric vehicles and renewable energy to telecommunications and AI.

The party’s big bet on high-tech industries may not end up benefiting most Chinese workers. Economists at Citigroup, a bank, point out that big industrial firms have shed 23m jobs since 2014. Automation, they argue, is largely to blame. Still, Mr Xi seems sure his approach to China’s development is the right one. “Sci-tech self-reliance is the key to building China into a great modern socialist country,” he told the nongchaoer group. Mr Xi’s “cordial exchange with us has strengthened our determination and sense of mission even more”, one later told state media. ■

# How to get rich in modern China | 当代中国致富经

### Some of the country’s brightest are cashing in on a state-backed surge

### 中国的一些顶尖人才正通过国家支持的产业浪潮获利

**February 26th 2026**

The year of the fire horse, which began on February 17th, is hardly **galloping** along for many Chinese. A property bust and chronic deflation have **eroded** people’s assets, incomes and prospects. Residential property, where Chinese people store the bulk of their wealth, has lost a fifth of its value on average since 2021. Wage growth is weak. And youth unemployment is hovering around 17%. Some graduates find themselves forced into **precarious** employment in the gig economy. Others say they are choosing to “lie flat” rather than look for a **grinding** job.
2月17日开始的丙午马年（火马年），对许多中国人来说并非快马加鞭的一年。房地产崩盘和长期通缩侵蚀了人们的资产、收入和前景。作为中国人存储大部分财富的载体，住宅地产自2021年以来平均贬值了五分之一。工资增长乏力，青年失业率在17%左右波动。一些毕业生发现自己被迫进入零工经济中从事不稳定的工作。另一些人则表示，他们宁愿选择“躺平”，也不愿去找一份折磨人的工作。

But in a sea of people losing, one group is winning. They are what Xi Jinping, China’s leader, calls *nongchaoer*: a Chinese term referring to those who “ride the tide” of great economic changes. Today that tide is flowing towards the strategic technologies, such as artificial intelligence and robotics, that dominate the country’s five-year plans for tech **supremacy** (the next one will be released in March and will cover the period to 2030). Smart, young and sometimes from modest backgrounds, the *nongchaoer* do not flash their growing wealth (and in any case, tend to prefer home-grown electric vehicles to Porsches). And they do not see officials as a source of **pesky** regulation to be avoided—but as their biggest backers. Mr Xi met a group of them publicly just before the lunar holiday.
但在众多的失意者中，有一个群体正在胜出。他们就是中国领导人习近平所称的“弄潮儿”：这是一个中文术语，指代那些在重大经济变革中“乘风破浪”的人。如今，这股浪潮正涌向人工智能和机器人等战略技术领域，这些领域在国家追求技术霸权的五年计划中占据主导地位（下一个五年计划将于3月发布，涵盖至2030年的时期）。这些“弄潮儿”聪明、年轻，有时出身平凡，他们不炫耀日益增长的财富（无论如何，他们往往更喜欢国产电动汽车而非保时捷）。他们并不把官员视为应避开的烦人监管者，而是视其为最大的支持者。在农历新年前夕，习近平公开接见了其中的代表。

These tide-riders are different from winners of the past in several ways. Education is an important one. In recent decades China’s economic rise created several waves of opportunity for the talented or lucky: from low-end manufacturing in the early 2000s to the rise of e-commerce in the 2010s and the property boom which lasted until 2021. Each **minted** its own millionaires and billionaires. In the boom times even a certificate from a **backwater** college could go a long way. In 2017 a survey of China’s 2,000 wealthiest entrepreneurs found that half had no degree at all.
这些“弄潮儿”在几个方面与过去的成功者不同。教育是重要的一环。在过去的几十年里，中国的经济崛起为有才华或幸运的人创造了几波机遇：从21世纪初的低端制造业，到2010年代的电子商务崛起，再到持续到2021年的房地产繁荣。每一波浪潮都创造了自己的百万富翁和亿万富翁。在繁荣时期，即使是偏远地区学院的文凭也能大有作为。2017年对中国2000名最富有企业家的调查发现，其中一半人根本没有学位。

But today’s *nongchaoer* are an elite bunch. They typically hold STEM degrees from one of China’s top 40-odd universities, known as the “985” group, which every year produce just 460,000 of the country’s 12m graduates (including masters and PhD students). The youngest members of the group that Mr Xi met, for example, included Zhang Linfeng, the co-founder of a company applying AI to science; Chen Jianyu, the founder of a robotics firm; and Wang He, another roboticist working on embodied AI. All were born in the 1990s and graduated from “985” institutions.
但今天的“弄潮儿”是一群精英。他们通常拥有中国40多所顶尖大学（即“985”高校）的理工科（STEM）学位。在中国每年1200万毕业生（含硕博）中，这些学校仅贡献了46万。例如，在习近平接见的群体中，最年轻的成员包括将人工智能应用于科学领域的公司联合创始人张林峰、机器人公司创始人陈建宇，以及另一位致力于具身智能的机器人专家王鹤。他们都出生于90年代，毕业于“985”院校。

Opportunities in China’s economy once lay in lots of places, from social connections to land. Now they primarily go to those who can grasp technology, says Li Jingyuan, a graduate of Zhejiang University (also a 985 college) and the founder of a company that makes 3D printers. Government data suggest that lucrative careers are increasingly concentrated in the highest **echelons** of tech. The financial sector, although still **cushy**, has seen only **sluggish** salary growth in the past few years amid a crackdown on bankers’ bonuses. Lawyers have fared worse.
浙江大学（也是985高校）毕业生、3D打印机公司创始人李景远表示，中国经济的机遇曾经分布在从社交关系到土地的许多地方，而现在主要流向那些能掌握技术的人。政府数据表明，高薪职业日益集中在科技行业的最高层。金融行业虽然依然优渥，但在打击银行家奖金的背景下，过去几年的薪资增长缓慢。律师的情况则更糟。

But the top tenth of software engineers by salary have seen their wages grow by 8% per year in real terms since 2020. The cleverest engineers have enjoyed pay rises amid a war for talent among China’s big-tech companies. An AI researcher at one such company in Beijing admits he has far more money than he knows what to do with (he spends most of his time at work and his hobby, hiking, is hard to splash cash on). DeepSeek, China’s AI darling, has been offering salaries of more than 1.4m yuan ($200,000) per year, ten times that of the average white-collar worker in China.
但自2020年以来，薪资排名前10%的软件工程师实际工资每年增长8%。在中国大型科技公司的人才争夺战中，最聪明的工程师享受到了加薪。北京一家此类公司的AI研究员承认，他的钱多到不知道怎么花（他大部分时间都在工作，而他的爱好——徒步旅行——很难挥金如土）。中国人工智能界的宠儿DeepSeek一直提供超过140万元人民币（约20万美元）的年薪，是普通中国白领平均薪资的十倍。

*Nongchaoer* tend to concentrate in just a few places: Yizhuang, a tech district in Beijing, Shenzhen, a southern electronics-manufacturing hub, and Hangzhou, a canal-crossed city in eastern China. On the surface their offices mimic those in Silicon Valley, complete with beanbags, table football and wandering robots. But the difference lies in the **looming** presence of the government. The walls bear framed pictures of visiting Communist Party cadres and awards from local officials praising “model” companies.
“弄潮儿”往往集中在少数几个地方：北京的科技区亦庄、南方的电子制造中心深圳，以及中国东部河网密布的城市杭州。表面上看，他们的办公室模仿硅谷，配有懒人沙发、桌上足球和四处走动的机器人。但不同之处在于政府无处不在的存在感。墙上挂着共产党员干部视察的照片，以及地方官员表彰“模范”公司的奖牌。

Only recently China’s tech sector was **battered** by officialdom. In 2020 Jack Ma, the founder of the tech giant Alibaba, made a speech attacking regulators for **stifling** innovation with “outdated supervision”. Mr Ma then disappeared from public view for several months and officials blocked the planned initial public offering of one of his companies. China has since squeezed its tech sector, with regulators targeting everything from cryptocurrency exchanges to video-game developers. Officials prefer the brightest and best to be in the strategic industries China needs to compete with America. Mr Xi has urged tech workers to “cultivate feelings of devotion towards serving the country”.
直到最近，中国的科技行业还遭受着官场的打击。2020年，科技巨头阿里巴巴的创始人马云发表演讲，指责监管机构以“过时的监管”扼杀创新。随后马云从公众视野中消失了几个月，官员们也阻止了他旗下公司原定的IPO（首次公开募股）。此后，中国压缩了科技行业的空间，监管机构的打击对象从加密货币交易所到视频游戏开发商不等。官员们更希望最顶尖的人才进入中国与美国竞争所需的战略产业。习近平敦促科技工作者要“培养服务国家的奉献情怀”。

The *nongchaoer* are keen to emphasise the ways officials help rather than **hinder** them. Policy can cause “uncertainties”, but it creates lots of “certainties” too, says Yi Haoxiang, the 35-year-old founder of a company in Hangzhou that makes AI-powered smart-glasses and a brain-computer interface intended to help treat depression (both are technologies the government has marked as national priorities). Local officials subsidise his research and development costs, office rent and travel to overseas conferences. Mr Yi praises the way officials “prevent excessive, destructive competition” by discouraging bidding wars over new patents from universities. “The government is the most stable force in the country, so the closer you get to it the more stable you become,” says Fred Chu, a 32-year-old whose company sells AI-powered monitoring software to the Hangzhou government for around 10m yuan a year. It is used for real-time tracking of road and environmental conditions.
“弄潮儿”们热衷于强调官员们是如何帮助而非阻碍他们的。35岁的易浩祥是杭州一家公司的创始人，该公司生产AI智能眼镜和旨在帮助治疗抑郁症的脑机接口（这两项技术都被政府列为国家重点）。他表示，政策可能带来“不确定性”，但也创造了许多“确定性”。地方官员资助他的研发成本、办公室租金以及参加海外会议的费用。易先生赞扬了官员们通过阻止对大学新专利的竞标战来“防止过度的、破坏性的竞争”。32岁的Fred Chu说：“政府是国家最稳定的力量，所以你离它越近，你就越稳定。”他的公司每年向杭州政府出售价值约1000万元的AI监控软件，用于实时监测道路和环境状况。

State-guided innovation of this sort has its problems. Priorities are set by central-government officials betting on the technologies they happen to think will prove critical. Local officials burn cash supporting favoured but feeble firms in their neighbourhoods. And state-supported industries can lurch from glory to gore if subsidies are pulled back. But for a shrewd entrepreneur willing to surf where directed, money **sloshes** from local-government **coffers**, state-owned companies and national venture-capital funds. Just in December China’s central government announced a new 100bn-yuan fund to invest in startups. And it is hard to deny that some of the results from all this state involvement are impressive. Chinese tech companies are now globally competitive in everything from electric vehicles and renewable energy to telecommunications and AI.
这种国家引导的创新也有其问题。优先级由中央政府官员设定，他们押注于那些他们恰好认为至关重要的技术。地方官员挥霍资金支持当地受宠但弱小的企业。如果补贴撤减，受国家支持的行业可能会从辉煌跌入低谷。但对于愿意按指令“冲浪”的精明企业家来说，资金正从地方政府的金库、国有企业和国家风险投资基金中滚滚而来。就在12月，中国中央政府宣布设立1000亿元的新基金投资初创企业。很难否认，这种国家参与取得了一些令人印象深刻的成果。中国科技公司现在在从电动汽车、可再生能源到电信和人工智能的各个领域都具有全球竞争力。

The party’s big bet on high-tech industries may not end up benefiting most Chinese workers. Economists at Citigroup point out that big industrial firms have shed 23m jobs since 2014. Automation, they argue, is largely to blame. Still, Mr Xi seems sure his approach to China’s development is the right one. “Sci-tech self-reliance is the key to building China into a great modern socialist country,” he told the *nongchaoer* group. Mr Xi’s “cordial exchange with us has strengthened our determination and sense of mission even more”, one later told state media.
党对高科技产业的豪赌最终可能不会惠及大多数中国工人。花旗银行的经济学家指出，自2014年以来，大型工业企业已经裁员2300万人。他们认为，自动化是主因。尽管如此，习近平似乎坚信他这种推动中国发展的方法是正确的。他在接见“弄潮儿”群体时说：“科技自立自强是把中国建设成为伟大的现代化社会主义强国的关键。”其中一人后来对官方媒体表示，习近平“与我们的亲切交流进一步增强了我们的决心和使命感”。
