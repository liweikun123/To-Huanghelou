# The right response to private-market dangers

Was a Blue Owl fund mismanaged, or did it reveal fundamental problems about the industry?

February 26th 2026

The giants of private investment risk seeing a tantalising prize slip from their grasp. Three of the biggest—Apollo, Blackstone and KKR—collectively oversee assets that have ballooned to $3trn, from $200bn in 2008. So far, they have had to raise the lion’s share of this from a select group of financial institutions and the über-rich. Now they and their competitors have the mass market in their sights. They have launched a wave of funds designed to entice retail savers to invest in unlisted assets such as private equity, property and private debt.

Their whole endeavour may now be under threat. On February 18th Blue Owl, a little-known firm, halted planned withdrawals from one of its retail funds. “OBDC II” has assets worth just $1.6bn. Yet news that Blue Owl has stopped redemptions, and is instead selling assets to return capital to all its investors, has sent shockwaves through the industry. Share prices fell in much bigger listed private-investment managers; half a dozen of them have lost a combined $100bn in market value since the start of the year.

That is because Blue Owl turned out to be a coal-mine canary. OBDC II has cast doubt on the model that such firms had hoped would “democratise” private investment and win them new revenue streams. Private-investment firms and their backers must now urgently work out what went wrong. Light regulation has let their markets boom for the better part of two decades. They cannot expect this to continue if they sell products to retail investors and do not honour their promises.

At stake are not just the revenues of a few asset managers. Access to private markets promises retail investors a way to share in big potential returns. The vast majority of the world’s assets are unlisted, including many of the most exciting businesses. Putting retail investors’ savings to work in private markets would also be a boon for the wider economy. Companies developing artificial intelligence are ravenous for capital, and Blue Owl’s funds are important lenders to them. In America in particular, such firms’ prospects will increasingly determine both the rate of growth and how well the country competes with China.

OBDC II aspired to solve a long-standing problem with retail investments in private markets. Directing savings towards private assets is difficult because they are illiquid. This makes regulators wary and puts off investors who like being able to buy or sell at the drop of a hat—if they need cash for an emergency, say. OBDC II used a model popularised by Blackstone’s Real Estate Income Trust, launched in 2017, which offers limited liquidity. Investors can ask to cash out each month or quarter, but the fund agrees to process total redemptions worth up to only 5% of its net asset value each quarter. Should requests exceed that figure, it caps the total at 5% and grants them pro rata.

Whether Blue Owl’s failure to stick to this was caused by its own incompetence, or by a fundamental flaw in the model, is still unclear. The very fact that this question remains unanswered should disturb anyone with a stake in institutions, such as pension schemes and university endowments, that are heavily exposed to unlisted assets. If regulators do not require funds like OBDC II to disclose far more about how they manage liquidity mismatches, their investors surely must.

Fortunately, the odds favour incompetence. A fund granting quarterly redemptions worth up to 5% of its assets is hardly promising the moon: at worst, it is offering to sell its portfolio over five years. This is the same as the typical wind-down period for standard private-markets funds. Providing regular liquidity ought to be especially easy for private-credit funds of OBDC II’s variety, since these invest in loans that pay interest, which can be used to meet redemptions.

For these reasons, it would be a mistake for zealous regulators to make it harder for ordinary people to buy private assets. It is, in truth, suspicious that private-investment giants are racing to sell to the mass market just when deals between them have slowed. But amateur investors are capable of scepticism. They can judge, for instance, the wisdom of investing in once-buzzy firms that were bought out during the mania of 2021, at “fair values” set by the seller. They should not expect to be bailed out—as they might if their bank collapsed—after making unwise investments.

Investors, meanwhile, should use their market power. They should not give money to managers whose operations are too opaque to understand. No fund promising annual returns in the high single-digit percentage points, or more, is a safe bet. It might hold loans that could fall through, property that could be left vacant or firms that could fail. If it also offers liquidity, while investing in illiquid assets, it could fail there, too. Responsible asset managers should help clients scrutinise these risks. If they do not, their golden opportunity may slip away. ■
